This is a tool originally designed to traverse a MarFS metadata reference tree
and generate a list of relevant MarFS objects when given paths within a MarFS
instance. Why the name MUSTANG? A Mustang is a car, and cars traverse!

## MarFS

This tool requires a running MarFS instance on the target machine or cluster.
Naturally, MUSTANG requires [MarFS](https://github.com/mar-file-system) and its
dependencies. Installation instructions and documentation can be found [here](http://mar-file-system.github.io/marfs/new_install.html).
